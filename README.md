# World's Worst Hello World
This is a random thing that I made in one day for no reason.

#### The goal: to use as many languages as possible to make a simple "Hello World" message.

If you (for some reason) want to run this, go to the cloned folder and type in these commands:

`cd code`

`sh depend.sh`

`sh main.sh`

And it will run the program.

Disclaimer: This will install a LOT of stuff onto your computer. to remove this, copy the depend.sh file, open it, replace `install` with `remove`, and delete all of the one you want to keep.

You can then save the file as something other than `depend.sh` and run it. it will now automatically uninstall all of the stuff that you chose.

If you get an error, you may not have Python 3 installed on your computer. if this may be the case, type this into the command prompt:

`sudo apt install python3 -y`

and try again.
